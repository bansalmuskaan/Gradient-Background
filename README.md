# Gradient-Background
A background gradient is composed of similar colors arranged from lightest to darkest or visa-versa. It can be designed as a linear gradient (horizontal or vertical) or a circular gradient or in a more complex arrangement like a rainbow of colors.

Gradients are CSS elements of the image data type that show a transition between two or more colors. These transitions are shown as either linear or radial. Because they are of the image data type, gradients can be used anywhere an image might be. The most popular use for gradients would be in a background element.
